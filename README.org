* Modeline
Started off with default emacs mode-line, then my own simple-modeline, which is stole from https://github.com/gexplorer/simple-modeline.
The most stand out modification was evil modal, which in an incident, buffer modification state was represent also by "梁" on some sort of conundrum, which I kept this beautiful mistake.
Now I am back on vanilla mode-line.

* Fonts
** Monospaced
- Menlo, Apple default
- SF Mono, apple terminal font

Bitmap, the resolution of it, it is less pleasant as I discovered after some use compared to other normal monospaced font.
